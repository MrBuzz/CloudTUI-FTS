### Description
CloudTUI-advanced is a tool that helps cloud users to manage workspaces in Nimbus. With this tool the user can easily
create/delete/monitor his workspaces and moreover, iti is possible to specify policy in order to decide when scale-up/scale-down the system. More details in "Scale-up and scale-down" paragraph. CloudTUI-advanced is written in python and uses boto libraries.

The source code is available here, while screenshots are availble here and, finally, a short demo video is here.

Please note that CloudTUI-advance is still in beta version. Some of the features could not work properly. We are working right now on fixing all bugs. Of course, we would be happy if you give a try to your software out and let us know what you think.
